Holy Roller sits in the garden we fled
Blood into wine, take my body instead
Holy Roller sits in the garden we fled
Blood into wine, take my body instead
Holy Roller

Stand
To the left of me
In paradise
Holy Ghosts will

Born of blood
In seraphim
To grip the Nazarene
Crown of God
You wear it thin
To come and rapture me
